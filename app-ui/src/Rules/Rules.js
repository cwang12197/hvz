                    <strong>THINGS TO NOTE:</strong> There is no due process of law. Community Chairs are judge, jury, and executioner.
                    All decisions are final. Excessive debating or arguing may result in point deductions from your family.
                </p>

                    Read all rules thoroughly before contacting us. Misunderstandings of clearly outlined rules may result 
                    in point deductions for wasting time.
