                <p><strong>NO RESTRAINING PEOPLE.</strong> Zombies can trap people but cannot restrain or block doors with humans.</p>
                <p><strong>ONLY ZOMBIES WEAR SOCKS.</strong> Humans carry socks to stun zombies but cannot wear them.</p>
                <p><strong>NO ATTACKING ON TRANSPORTATION.</strong> Stay safeâ€”avoid attacking anyone on vehicles or during travel.</p>
                <p><strong>REPORT KILLS IMMEDIATELY.</strong> Submit kill reports by midnight for them to count.</p>
                <p><strong>ZOMBIES ACTIVATE NEXT DAY.</strong> Newly killed humans turn into zombies at 12:00 AM.</p>
                <p><strong>ZOMBIES CAN SNEAK UP.</strong> Beware! Zombies can sneak behind for kills.</p>
                <p><strong>ONLY THE STUNNER IS SAFE.</strong> A stunned zombie can still attack others.</p>
                <p><strong>RESPECT SAFE ZONES.</strong> Avoid classrooms and use judgment when attacking near professors.</p>
                <p><strong>NO PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS.</strong> Participants cannot restrain others to prevent stuns or attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>RESPECT PROPERTY AND SAFETY.</strong> No theft, property damage, or dangerous behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>SOCK GLOVES ONLY FOR KILLS.</strong> Zombies must wear socks on their hands to tag humans.</p>
                <p><strong>STAY SAFE AND HAVE FUN!</strong> Safety comes first, and dangerous behavior will result in disqualification.</p>
                <p><strong>NON-PLAYERS CAN'T INTERFERE.</strong> Support humans, but non-players cannot physically block zombies.</p>
