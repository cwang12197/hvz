                <p><strong>ONLY ZOMBIES WEAR SOCKS.</strong> Humans can carry socks to stun zombies but cannot wear them and pretend to be a zombie.</p>
                <p><strong>NO ATTACKING HUMANS ON TRANSPORTATION.</strong> Stay safeâ€”avoid attacking anyone on vehicles (e.g. cars, bikes, buses, skateboards) and don't cram people into vehicles for the sake of avoiding an attack.</p>

                <p><strong>ZOMBIES ACTIVATE NEXT DAY AT 12 AM.</strong> Newly killed humans turn into zombies at midnight. Be sure to als check the document to ensure your death has been recorded.</p>
